#### It's easy to learn !

You use the # character to control heading size. One # in front of some text will give you a BIG heading, (like 1), two will make it a bit smaller, (like 2), three smaller still, (like 3). 

You can easily make text **bold** or *italic*. Surround text you want bold with two stars ** on either side and text to be italic with one star * on either side.

Make bulleted lists by using hyphens, e.g.

- item one
- item two
- item three

Make numbered lists by using numbers.

1. item one
2. item two
3. item three

Links aren't too hard. Put the link text inside square brackets, followed by the link itself inside round brackets, with no spaces in between, and voila!

The good thing is you can use a program called `pandoc` to output Markdown as a `.pdf`, as `.html` or even as formatted text for a program like Word to process.

So you can create a text once and use it in many ways! Find out more with this [easy-to-follow lesson.](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)

Last but not least - in order to render properly, files must be saved as filename`.md`. The `.md` indicates that the file is a Markdown file.
