### Why I like Markdown

Easy to learn !

You can easily make text **bold** or *italic*.

Make lists by using hyphens, e.g.

- item one
- item two
- item three

Make numbered lists by using numbers.

1. item one
2. item two
3. item three


Links aren't too hard. Put the link text inside square brackets, followed by the link itself inside round brackets, with no spaces in between, and voila!

The good thing is you can use a program called `pandoc` to output Markdown as a `pdf`, as `html` or even as formatted text for a program like Word.
